### 2. Related Work
Next path prediction has been studied in various domains, including navigation systems [1], autonomous vehicles [2], and mathematical problem-solving [3]. Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based systems or heuristics to generate candidate paths [4]. However, these methods may struggle to capture complex dependencies and adapt to diverse scenarios.

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of data-driven approaches for next path prediction. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) [5] and gated recurrent units (GRU) [6], have been widely used to model sequential data and capture temporal dependencies. However, these models may suffer from vanishing gradients and have limited ability to capture long-range dependencies.

Transformer-based models, such as GPT [7], BERT [8], and XLNet [9], have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and generating coherent sequences. These models have been successfully applied to various tasks, including language modeling, machine translation, and text generation. In the context of next path prediction, transformers have shown promising results in capturing complex dependencies and generating plausible paths [10].

Reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q-learning [11] and SARSA [12], have been used to learn optimal decision-making policies in various domains. These methods learn from interactions with the environment and can adapt to dynamic scenarios. In the context of next path prediction, reinforcement learning can be used to learn optimal pathfinding policies based on user preferences and contextual factors [13].

Graph search algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm [14] and A* search [15], have been widely used for efficient pathfinding in graph-based representations. These algorithms can generate optimal paths based on predefined criteria and heuristics. In the context of next path prediction, graph search algorithms can be used to generate diverse candidate paths and incorporate domain-specific knowledge [16].

Our proposed architecture builds upon these existing techniques and integrates transformers, Q-learning, and A* search to achieve accurate and efficient next path prediction in mathematics. We leverage the strengths of each component to capture complex dependencies, learn optimal pathfinding policies, and generate diverse candidate paths.

### 3. Methodology
#### 3.1 Data Preprocessing
The first step in our architecture is data preprocessing. We collect a diverse and representative dataset covering various path types and scenarios in mathematical problem-solving. To handle missing data, we employ appropriate imputation techniques, such as KNN imputation [17] or matrix factorization [18]. We apply robust feature scaling methods, such as robust scaler [19] or quantile transformer [20], to normalize the data and handle outliers. Advanced outlier detection techniques, like isolation forest [21] or local outlier factor [22], are used to identify and handle anomalous data points. We perform feature engineering and selection to create meaningful features and reduce dimensionality using techniques like PCA [23], t-SNE [24], or autoencoders [25]. Stratified sampling techniques are used to ensure balanced representation of different path types and scenarios in the training data.

#### 3.2 Path Encoding
In the path encoding step, we choose a suitable path element representation, such as road segments, coordinates, or landmarks, based on the granularity and context of the problem. We apply state-of-the-art embedding techniques, such as word2vec [26], GloVe [27], or fastText [28], to convert path elements into dense vector representations. We experiment with different embedding dimensions and context-aware embedding techniques, like ELMo [29] or BERT [8], to capture the semantic meaning of path elements. Additionally, we consider using graph neural networks (GNNs) [30] to capture the structural information of the road network and learn node and edge embeddings.

#### 3.3 Path Finding Module
The path finding module is responsible for generating diverse candidate paths. We build an accurate and efficient graph representation of the road network using advanced graph construction techniques, such as contraction hierarchies [31] or hub labeling [32]. We implement and compare multiple pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm [14], A* search [15], and bidirectional search [33], to generate diverse candidate paths. Real-time traffic information and historical data are incorporated into the pathfinding process using streaming data processing frameworks like Apache Kafka [34] or Apache Flink [35]. We utilize reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q-learning [11] or SARSA [12], to learn optimal pathfinding policies based on user preferences and contextual factors.

#### 3.4 Next Path Prediction Module
The next path prediction module utilizes transformer-based models to predict the most likely next steps in mathematical problem-solving. We experiment with different transformer architectures, such as GPT [7], BERT [8], or XLNet [9], to find the most suitable one for the next path prediction task. We fine-tune pretrained transformer models on the path prediction task to leverage transfer learning and capture complex dependencies between path elements. Additional context information, such as user preferences, weather conditions, or time of day, is incorporated into the model input to improve prediction accuracy. We use appropriate regularization techniques, like dropout [36] or L1/L2 regularization [37], and optimize the loss function using advanced techniques, such as AdamW [38] or Rectified Adam [39]. Techniques like gradient clipping [40] and learning rate scheduling [41] are employed to stabilize training and improve convergence.

#### 3.5 Training and Evaluation
We use a large and diverse dataset for training, with proper train-validation-test splits to assess model performance and generalization. Early stopping [42] and model checkpointing [43] are implemented to prevent overfitting and save the best-performing models during training. We use appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, or mean average precision [44], and perform cross-validation to assess model performance comprehensively. Ablation studies and sensitivity analysis are conducted to understand the contribution of different components and identify potential vulnerabilities or areas for improvement. Ensemble techniques, like bagging [45] or boosting [46], are employed to combine multiple models and improve overall robustness and generalization.

#### 3.6 Inference and Path Generation
During inference, we implement efficient beam search [47] or top-k sampling [48] strategies for path generation, considering the trade-off between diversity and quality. Appropriate stopping criteria are set based on the specific goal and maximum path length to ensure generated paths are meaningful and practical. We evaluate the quality of generated paths using both quantitative measures, such as perplexity [49] or edit distance [50], and qualitative measures, including user studies and expert feedback.

#### 3.7 Interpretability and Explainability
To enhance the interpretability and explainability of our model, we use attention visualization techniques [51] to understand which path elements the model focuses on during prediction and identify important dependencies. Advanced interpretation methods, such as SHAP [52], LIME [53], or integrated gradients [54], are applied to explain the model's predictions and identify influential features or path elements. We conduct qualitative analysis and user studies to ensure the generated paths and explanations are reasonable, interpretable, and align with human intuition.

#### 3.8 Scalability and Deployment
To ensure the scalability and efficient deployment of our architecture, we optimize the model architecture and inference process for real-time performance, considering factors like latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Distributed training techniques and computing frameworks, such as Apache Spark [55] or Dask [56], are used to handle large-scale datasets and reduce training time. The trained model is deployed using efficient serving frameworks and hardware, like TensorFlow Serving [57] or NVIDIA Triton [58], to ensure fast and reliable inference. Model compression techniques, such as quantization [59] or pruning [60], are implemented to reduce model size and improve inference speed without significant loss in accuracy. Containerization technologies, like Docker [61] or Kubernetes [62], are employed for seamless deployment, scalability, and portability across different environments. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented to automate model updates, ensure reproducibility, and maintain high-quality standards.
